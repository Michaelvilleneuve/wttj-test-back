Here is the back-end of the WTTJ test.

## Running

```bash
bundle

ruby app.rb
```

## Testing

```bash
bundle

rake
```

## Roadmap

A list of things I would be improving in an actual project :

- Error handling (there is currently none :D) 
- Improving flexibility of both broadcast and direct response
- Environment/deployment/ci management
- Add an actual database and ORM
- Better testing of websocket connection and some scale tests
- Add some autoloading in tests
